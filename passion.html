                                          During a trip to Scheveningen with my friends, I had the chance to visit the Sea Life Aquarium. As I walked through the exhibits, I noticed that many fish were confined to small, cramped tanks, far from their natural habitats in the wild. The aquarium's maintenance was poor, with a noticeable bad smell and some tanks that had not been cleaned properly. I saw several fish that appeared unhealthy or even dead. This experience sparked an idea in my mind: why not create a concept that addresses these issues by using technology, eliminating the need for real animals, and providing a better, more ethical way to showcase animal life?

                                          <br>My main question is: What problems are traditional zoos dealing with today, and how do these problems affect the well-being of animals, conservation work, and how the public views zoos?
                                          <br>To answer this, I will look into several sub-questions that focus on different aspects of zoo environments and their effects on animals and visitors.
                                       <br>   Sub-Questions:
                                          <br>1.	How do traditional zoo environments affect the health and happiness of animals?
                                          <br>2.	What signs show that animals in zoos might be stressed or unhappy?
                                          <br>3.	Do zoo animals have enough space and things to do to keep them active and engaged?
                                          <br>4.	How effective are traditional zoos in teaching visitors about the animals and their natural behaviors?
                                          <br>5.	How do visitors feel about the conditions and care of animals in traditional zoos?
                                          <br>6.	How does the expertise of zoo staff affect the care and well-being of the animals?
                                          <br>7.	How do management problems affect how well zoos can care for their animals?
                                          <br>I conducted primary research, including observations and interviews at Zoo Veldhoven, to gather firsthand insights. I also used secondary research methods, such as literature analysis and data analysis, to support my findings. My goal is to better understand the current state of traditional zoos, especially in terms of animal care and education, to suggest ways to improve their practices.

To better understand my audience, I visited Zoo Veldhoven to observe the environment and conduct interviews with visitors. I asked them about their feelings regarding the conditions and care of the animals, whether they thought the animals looked happy and healthy, and how the zoo‚Äôs appearance affected their overall view.
                                          <br>Based on a survey of the Dutch public's views on zoo animals, people generally support zoos as long as the animals can behave naturally. About 62% of people said that if zoo animals cannot show their natural behaviors, then those animals should not be kept in zoos.

                                          Traditional zoos raise concerns about animal welfare, environmental impact, and limitations in the types of animals that can be housed. The logistics and ethical issues of keeping exotic and endangered species in captivity, coupled with the growing awareness of the need for conservation, have led to a demand for more sustainable and humane alternatives.
                                          <br>There is a need for an innovative solution that can provide an immersive, educational, and engaging experience for the public without compromising the well-being of animals.

By creating new ways to experience and learn about wildlife, we can maintain the educational and engaging aspects of a zoo without the need for real animals. Technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, interactive displays, and lifelike simulations can provide a more humane and sustainable way to showcase the wonders of the natural world. This approach not only enhances the visitor experience but also promotes conservation and a deeper respect for animals and their habitats, all while addressing ethical concerns associated with traditional zoos.

                                          I brainstorm ideas to find new ways to improve the well-being of animals in zoos. I want to explore how future technology can help make zoos better for animals. My goal is to come up with creative solutions that use new tech to solve problems like limited space, lack of stimulation, and poor living conditions.

                                    <br>      I chose to use hologram technology for this project because:
                                     <br>     No Physical Space Needed: Unlike virtual reality or augmented reality, which often require special equipment or space, holograms create images in the air that don‚Äôt need extra gear or large setups.
                                     <br>     Less Stress for Animals: Holograms don‚Äôt involve real animals, so there‚Äôs no risk of causing stress or health issues that can happen with live animals or robotic animals.
                                      <br>    Easier Maintenance: Holograms don‚Äôt need cleaning, feeding, or medical care like live animals do. They are simple to maintain compared to robotic animals or actual zoo enclosures.
                                     <br>     High Realism: Holograms can provide a highly realistic visual experience without the limitations of virtual reality, which can sometimes feel less immersive due to screen boundaries.
                                      <br>    Cost-Effective: Once set up, holograms can be cheaper to run than robotic animals, which might need repairs and updates. They also eliminate ongoing costs for animal care and enclosure upkeep.

                                          The main concept of a hologram zoo is to use advanced technology to create lifelike, 3D images of animals. Instead of having real animals in enclosures, visitors see and interact with holograms of animals.                                    </p>

                                      <br>    Conservation means taking care of nature and animals, making sure they stay safe and healthy. Innovation means using new and creative ideas to solve problems.
                                      <br>    So, this tagline suggests that the project is all about blending the efforts to protect wildlife with the latest technology. It shows that we can use modern tools and ideas to help in conservation, making sure that our approach is both effective and forward-thinking.
                                                                              </p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="1s">
                                      <br>    Better Animal Welfare: Holograms allow us to show animals without keeping them in cages, so real animals will not feel cramped or stressed.
                                      <br>    Education and Awareness: Visitors can learn about animals in a more interactive and detailed way, helping them understand wildlife better and care more about conservation.
                                       <br>   Innovation in Zoos: Using holograms introduces new technology to zoos, making them more modern and exciting for visitors.
                                      <br>    Conservation Support: By reducing the need for live animals in zoos, we support efforts to protect their natural habitats and focus on real conservation work.
                                      <br>    Accessible Learning: People who canott visit traditional zoos can still experience and learn about animals through holograms.
                                        <br>  Cost Savings: Maintaining holograms can be cheaper than caring for live animals, allowing funds to be directed towards conservation and education efforts.

                                          Before I began this project, I knew I needed a stakeholder to provide insightful feedback, guidance, and a fresh perspective, as well as to help test my prototype. Fortunately, I met Mr. William Kuiper, an IT expert ‚Äì majoring in Embedded Systems Test Automation who was actively seeking new ideas or projects that could positively impact social issues.
                                    <br>I shared my idea with Mr. Kuiper about using holographic technology to address the problems in traditional zoos. I asked him for guidance, feedback, and suggestions throughout this project.                                    </p>

                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢ Material Suitability: The materials I am currently using are not ideal because they are not dark enough for the holographic images to be clear and sharp. I should research similar projects to see how they addressed this issue. He suggested using a frame that is dark-colored and lightweight. While wood is stable, it is heavy and not easy to move. Also, the glass screen is too thick, making the image appear blurry and less 3D. I should look into alternative materials that offer better clarity and depth.
                                          
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢ Functionality Improvements: He recommended that I research moving or gesture recognition technology. This would allow users to interact more naturally with the holographic animals. For example, users could move their hands to rotate or zoom in and out, allowing them to view the animal from different angles. Adding these features could greatly enhance user engagement and make the experience more interactive.
                                          
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢ Example from Australia: He shared an example of a similar project in Australia, which currently requires users to wear VR glasses and lacks features for interacting directly with the screen or animals. He suggested I visit their website to learn more about their challenges and see which features I could add to my project to make it more innovative and user-friendly.

                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢ Research Suitable Materials: I should explore materials that provide a darker background and are lightweight, yet still stable. This could improve image clarity and make the display easier to move around.
                                          
                                          <br>     ‚Ä¢ Explore Gesture Recognition Technology: Investigating technologies that support gesture recognition could allow users to have a more interactive and engaging experience.
                                          
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢ Learn from Existing Projects: Studying similar projects, like the one in Australia, can provide valuable insights into what features work well and what could be improved. This could help me develop a more innovative and user-friendly hologram zoo experience.                                    </p>

                                          What I Learned About the Hologram Zoo in Australia: (website - hologramzoo.com.au)
                                          <br>The Hologram Zoo in Australia uses special technology to create a virtual zoo. Instead of having real animals, they use 3D holograms to display animals in a fun and interactive way. These holograms make the animals look like they are really there, giving visitors a unique experience without needing to keep animals in cages.
                                          <br>Main Features:
                                          <br>1.	Holographic Screens: The zoo uses special screens that show 3D images of animals. These screens make the animals look very realistic, and visitors can see them from different angles, almost like the animals are really there in front of them.
                                          <br>2.	Learning About Animals: The hologram zoo provides lots of information about each animal, like where they live, what they eat, and how they behave. This helps visitors learn more about wildlife and understand the importance of protecting these animals in the wild.
                                          <br>3.	Visual Interaction: Right now, visitors need to wear VR glasses to see the holograms properly. These glasses make the animals look more detailed and real. However, the experience is mostly about looking at the animals, and there isn‚Äôt much interaction beyond that.
                                          <br>4.	Focus on Conservation: The main goal of the project is to teach people about animal conservation. By using holograms instead of real animals, the zoo does not need to take animals from their natural habitats. This helps promote the ethical treatment of animals and highlights the importance of protecting them in the wild.
                                          <br>Problems and Challenges:
                                          <br>‚Ä¢	VR Glasses Required: Visitors still need to wear VR glasses to get the full experience. Not everyone likes wearing these glasses for a long time, which can make the experience less enjoyable.
                                          <br>‚Ä¢	Limited Interaction: The current setup doesn‚Äôt allow visitors to interact with the holograms in a more engaging way. Adding more interactive features, like touch or gesture controls, could make the experience more fun and interesting.
                                          <br>Ideas for Improving My Project:
                                          <br>1.	No VR Glasses Needed: I could work on making my hologram zoo experience without needing VR glasses. This would make it easier and more comfortable for everyone to enjoy.
                                          <br>2.	Gesture Controls: Adding gesture controls would let visitors interact with the holograms by moving their hands. They could rotate, zoom in, or view the animals from different angles, making the experience more interactive.
                                          <br>3.	More Interactive Learning: I could add more ways for visitors to learn, like interactive games or quizzes about the animals. This would make learning about wildlife more fun and engaging.
                                          <br>4.	Better Display Technology: Using better screens that are thinner and clearer could make the holograms look even more real. This would improve the overall experience and make the images sharper and more lifelike.

                                          <br>      Tech Research on Gesture Recognition for My Hologram Zoo Project
                                          <br>      What is Gesture Recognition?
                                          <br>      Gesture recognition is a technology that allows computers to understand and interpret human movements, especially hand gestures. This means a computer can "see" what a person is doing with their hands and respond to those actions. For example, if you wave your hand in front of a sensor, the computer can recognize this wave and take a specific action, like starting a program or moving an object on the screen.
                                          <br>      How Gesture Recognition Works:
                                          <br>      1.	Sensors and Cameras: Gesture recognition systems use sensors and cameras to capture movements. These devices take pictures or videos of a person‚Äôs hands and track their movements in real-time.
                                          <br>      2.	Software Algorithms: The captured movements are processed by software algorithms that analyze them. These algorithms detect specific gestures, like swiping, pinching, or rotating, by recognizing patterns in the movement data.
                                          <br>      3.	Interaction with Digital Content: Once the system understands the gesture, it translates that gesture into a command. For example, a swipe gesture might mean moving to the next screen, or a pinch might mean zooming in on a picture.
                                          <br>      Why Use Gesture Recognition in My Hologram Zoo Project?
                                          <br>      By using gesture recognition, I can make the hologram zoo experience more interactive and engaging for visitors. Instead of just looking at the holograms, visitors can use hand movements to interact with the animals. For example:
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢	Rotate the Animals: Visitors can rotate the holograms with a simple swipe motion to see the animals from different angles.
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢	Zoom In and Out: By pinching or spreading their fingers, visitors can zoom in to see details of the animal or zoom out for a broader view.
                                          <br>      ‚Ä¢	Move the Animals: With a wave or drag gesture, visitors could move the animals around, giving them more control over their viewing experience.
                                          <br>      How I Applied Gesture Recognition to My Project:
                                          <br>      To add gesture recognition to my hologram zoo, I needed to do a lot of research and learning. Here‚Äôs what I did:
                                          <br>      1.	Learning About Gesture Recognition Technology: I spent over a week studying different technologies and tools that can detect and recognize gestures. I learned about the different types of sensors, like Kinect or Leap Motion (https://www.ultraleap.com/), which are commonly used for gesture recognition.
                                          <br>      2.	Choosing the Right Tools: After researching, I chose the tools that would work best for my project. I selected a sensor that can detect hand movements accurately and software that can interpret these movements and translate them into commands for the hologram display.
                                          <br>      3.	Integrating the Technology: I then worked on integrating the gesture recognition system with my hologram zoo setup. This took more time than I expected, as I needed to make sure the sensors and software worked smoothly with the holograms.
                                          <br>      4.	Testing and Troubleshooting: I spent several days testing the system and troubleshooting issues. For example, sometimes the gestures were not recognized correctly, or the system was too slow to respond. I had to tweak the software settings and adjust the sensors to improve accuracy and speed.
                                          <br>      5.	Making it User-Friendly: Finally, I focused on making the gesture recognition system easy to use for visitors. I adjusted the sensitivity of the sensors to ensure they could detect gestures without requiring too much effort, making the experience seamless and enjoyable.
                                          <br>      6.	Coding with TensorFlow.js (https://www.tensorflow.org/js): For the coding part, I used TensorFlow.js, a powerful library that allows me to build machine learning models directly in the browser using JavaScript. This was crucial for recognizing gestures in real time and making the interactions smooth and responsive. TensorFlow.js helped me create a model that can detect different hand gestures and translate them into actions within the hologram zoo.

                                          I presented my rapid prototype with an iPad display to Mr. Kuipers to ask for initial feedback and suggestions that I can use to make improvements before moving on to the mid-fidelity prototype. I want him to test a few features, such as the visibility of the image on the screen, whether it feels like a 3D hologram, and what functionalities it could have to get users to interact with it. </p>

                                          I began by using the Creative Technology Design Tool to identify potential triggers for this project. Through this tool, I explored various factors that could influence the project's direction and outcomes. This process helped me uncover different possibilities and challenges that I needed to consider as I moved forward. By doing this, I was able to form a clearer understanding of what might drive the project's success and where potential issues could arise.

                                          During a trip to Scheveningen with my friends, I had the chance to visit the Sea Life Aquarium. As I walked through the exhibits, I noticed that many fish were confined to small, cramped tanks, far from their natural habitats in the wild. The aquarium's maintenance was poor, with a noticeable bad smell and some tanks that had not been cleaned properly. I saw several fish that appeared unhealthy or even dead. This experience sparked an idea in my mind: why not create a concept that addresses these issues by using technology, eliminating the need for real animals, and providing a better, more ethical way to showcase animal life?
